## Realtime Chat App with NestJS and Angular
### 11. Video (Angular, Add ChatRoom Creation with realtime User Search)

You need:
- Angular
- Nestjs
- npm
- docker

Story:
As a user we want to be able to create new chatrooms.
The chatrooms should have at least a name and one user. I should be able to select the users by a search for the username.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Chatrooms can be created 
    1. FormGroup/FormControl/FormArray
    2. Input/Output vs @ViewComponent
    3. form submit 
- we can search in realtime for users by their username 
    - HTML: 
        1. <input> + FormControl
        2. <mat-autocomplete> : 
            - function: (optionSelected), 
            - property: [displayWith]
        3. <ng-template> 
        ```
        *ngIf="selectedUsers.length > 0; else no_users"
        #no_users
        ```
    - TS:
        1. Input : ngOnChanges()
        2. Output: EventEmitter.emit()
        3. Observable : pipe vs subscribe 
        4. startWith,switchMap, debounceTime,distinctUntilChanged 

- while in room creation, we also can remove users before the final creation of the room
