## Realtime Chat App with NestJS and Angular
### 3. Video

You need:
- Angular
- Nestjs
- npm
- docker

Story:
As a developer i want to have the security (atm: bcrypt and Jwt Stuff) in a separate Authentication Module.
All security stuff should be in a separate module, so we can import it later to every module where we need it.
We also want to generate a jwt on login and be able to secure routes with a jwtguard.

Acceptance Criteria:
- new auth module (/)
- bcrypt stuff moves to auth module (/)
- generate and return a jwt with user payload after user login (/)
    - Use @netsjs/jwt : signAsync to generate Token
    - Deploy async use Factory 
    - Provide the secret 
- have a guard, that checks for a valid jwt (/)
    - Angular Guard implement CanActivate
        1. get token from header (Bearer)
        2. use jwtService verify the token
    - passport 
        1. JwtAuthGuard extends AuthGuard('jwt')
        2. JwtStrategy extends PassportStrategy(Strategy)
            - fromAuthHeaderAsBearerToken
            - validate

- make the GET /api/users protected by the JwtAuthGuard (/)
