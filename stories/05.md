## Realtime Chat App with NestJS and Angular
### 5. Video (Angular: User Login with Reactive Forms and JWT saving)

You need:
- Angular
- Nestjs
- npm
- docker

Story:
As a User i want to be able to login to the app with my credentials.
The input data should be validated. When my provided data was correct then the returned jwt token from the backend should be saved
into the localstorage of the browser.
The Auth Guard for the /private/ route should be updated, so that it checks, if there is a jwt in the localstorage that is not expired.

Acceptance Criteria:
- login form with reactive forms 
    1. check the email format - Validator.email
    2. login send data to server, and get server response
        - fetch api proxy : check the server and config 
        - response should be json
    3. login successfully redirect to homepage
    4. add guard of the private moduel (to the nextnext step )
- save jwt in localstorage 
    1. LocalStorage.setItem
- update auth guard to check for expiration of jwt/if jwt exists 
    1. This auth guard is for the private : not for user login use token in cookie without the credentials 
    2. Redirect to the private moduel
    3. So this guard only valid the token time, not compare same or not.
